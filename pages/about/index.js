          Vietnam is identified by IPCC( The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
          Change) as one of the countries likely to be most affected by climate
          change due to its extensive coastline, vast deltas and floodplains,
          location on the path of typhoons as well as its large population in
          poverty. There have been many difficulties and pains that Vietnamese
          people have experienced for the last decade.

          For example, the Central floods have wreaked havoc on the lives of
          millions. Climate change&apos;s effects, such as rising sea levels,
          saltwater intrusion, and prolonged droughts, have put millions of
          lives at risk in Vietnam&apos;s Mekong Delta. However, many people
          have failed to recognize the importance of climate change in their
          lives, viewing it solely as a natural disaster. In many cases, there
          are only two in my country. More seriously, we must acknowledge that
          these challenges have threatened the Vietnamese people&apos;s lives,
          particularly those of vulnerable and minority groups, and have
          drastically altered their lives in areas such as health, education,
          livestock, and so on.
