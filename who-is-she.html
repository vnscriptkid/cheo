For the last decade, there have been accountable difficulties and pains experienced by Vietnamese people.</p><p>“Who is she?” is an ongoing documentation that will seek out and tell the stories of Vietnamese girls who are part of the marginalized group most affected by climate change. However, because of their diverse backgrounds, education, and traditions, each girl would try a different approach to dealing with the situation. It is also a project to discover “unknown” things because the effects of climate change on these girls would be completely different and would lead them to particular life choices.</p><p>Project is in process with support from Girl Rising (Future Rising Fellowship).</p></div><div class="react-multi-carousel-list carousel-container "><ul class="react-multi-carousel-track " style="transition:none;overflow:unset;transform:translate3d(0px,0,0)"></ul></div></main></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/who-is-she","query":{},"buildId":"wAYr7_ZIxr_S23dEhb5nj","assetPrefix":"/cheo","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
