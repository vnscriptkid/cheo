Thu\u2019s steps quickened despite the full load of firewood burdening her shoulder. Thu\u2019s sister-in-law walked before her, her steps steady as she crossed the streambed, trying to make her way through before dusk. Suddenly the whirlpool intensified, and its currents grew more rapid. Thu looked far beyond, trying to figure out what could be the matter.

It\u2019s getting dangerous.\u201d Not so long after, the water rose to above their knees, then higher, and soon reached her waists. Thu was worried though she had been in this situation before.

Beside her, the sister-in-law was applying a bit more of anti infection medicine on her legs. This medicine is indispensable for the women of this D\u1ed7i Hamlet, especially during these rainy days when their feet get long-exposed to water. It\u2019s an everyday task to the C\u01a1 Tu women in this hamlet to fetch firewood and wade through the streams for fish. The firewood would reduce the fuel cost, a major spending of a household. Each three to four hard-working hours of collecting firewood secures a month-worth of fuel. Income from cultivation activities becomes less stable, so any least of cost reduction would suffice the effort. However, landslides on hill tops, water rising from hydro power plant\u2019s drainage, and sudden rains in Nam \u0110\xf4ng make this task more arduous.":"T\u1ed1i \u0111\u1ebfn, d\u01b0\u1edbi \xe1nh \u0111\xe8n nh\u1ecf trong gian b\u1ebfp nh\xe0 ch\u1ecb g\xe1i, Thu k\u1ec3 l\u1ea1i l\u1ea7n \u0111i\n        g\xe1nh c\u1ee7i l\xfac chi\u1ec1u m\xe0 l\xf2ng v\u1eabn b\u1ea7n th\u1ea7n.

At such an age, most of her friends opt for the option of moving to the city for jobs or becoming textiles workers for factories near home. They all would work to earn some funds before returning to cultivation activities, simply because it has no longer provided as stably as it did. In Nam \u0110\xf4ng, many young girls quit school to work before the legal age. The story of D\xedp, Thu\u2019s sister-in-law and her constant supporter when she first moved in, is typical of this type. D\xedp started working at the age of 15 and kept it from her family, after being introduced by her friends to a well-paid job in the city. A few years later, she returned with a humble fund, swore never to return to the miserable job, and instead to stick to her rather desolate field at home. Unlike D\xedp\u2019s case, Thu\u2019s parents sent her to boarding school down the district lest she leaves too. Now that Thu is a mother to a four-year-old girl and a young wife to a family of very few members, leaving for city jobs is indeed not of one her intentions, though she would earn much more.":"C\u01b0\u1edbi ch\u1ed3ng n\u0103m 18 tu\u1ed5i, Thu chuy\u1ec3n v\u1ec1 th\xf4n D\u1ed7i \u1edf c\xf9ng gia \u0111\xecnh ch\u1ed3ng. \u1ede\n        l\u1ee9a tu\u1ed5i c\u1ee7a em l\xfac \u1ea5y, h\u1ea7u h\u1ebft c\xe1c b\u1ea1n \u0111\u1ec1u l\u1ef1a ch\u1ecdn l\xean th\xe0nh ph\u1ed1 ki\u1ebfm\n        vi\u1ec7c l\xe0m ho\u1eb7c l\xe0m nh\xe2n c\xf4ng \u1edf c\xe1c x\u01b0\u1edfng may g\u1ea7n nh\xe0.

The wattle trees from 2020\u2019s cultivation season were all damaged. Besides, rubber tapping is not possible during rainy seasons. And so Thu\u2019s husband\u2019s freelance job and some cassava (a type of starchy root vegetable) grown in their garden have been the only sources of income. This situation is shared by D\xedp\u2019s and many other women\u2019s families in the hamlet. A five-year season of wattle of half a hectare could give an interest of 20 to 30 million Vietnam dongs (roughly $860 to $1300). Because of severe storms and landslides, they earned nothing in 2020. These disasters also influenced other crops like rubber, cassava, corn, and rice. At the same time, the pandemic has put great pressure on their economic activities. Even their most stable source of income from rubber tapping, with which they earn 300,000VND ($13) a day, is hampered by the rain. The scarce and occasional money they get from cassava and corn crops is often not enough to make ends meet. Therefore, a job in a factory with a stable income is a preferable choice for young women like Thu and D\xedp. Or perhaps, the men are to be the only breadwinners.":"Ng\u01b0\u1ee3c l\u1ea1i, n\u1ed7i b\u1eadn t\xe2m c\u1ee7a em g\xf3i gh\xe9m trong nh\u1eefng b\u1eefa \u0103n h\xe0ng ng\xe0y,\n        trong r\u1eaby keo m\u1edbi \u0111\u1ed5 g\xe3y v\xec c\u01a1n b\xe3o \u0111i qua, hay trong ngu\u1ed3n thu nh\u1eadp b\u1ea5p\n        b\xeanh t\u1eeb tr\u1ed3ng tr\u1ecdt. \u0110\u1ee3t keo tr\u1ed3ng n\u0103m 2020 c\u1ee7a gia \u0111\xecnh em \u0111\u1ec1u b\u1ecb \u0111\u1ed5 g\xe3y\n        h\u1ebft, cao su c\u0169ng kh\xf4ng thu ho\u1ea1ch \u0111\u01b0\u1ee3c v\xe0o m\xf9a m\u01b0a gi\xf3, n\xean ngu\u1ed3n thu\n        ch\xednh ch\u1ec9 c\xf2n ph\u1ee5 thu\u1ed9c v\xe0o c\xf4ng vi\u1ec7c t\u1ef1 do c\u1ee7a ch\u1ed3ng, hay m\u1ed9t \xedt c\u1ee7 m\xec\n        tr\u1ed3ng sau nh\xe0.

Slippery roads and landslides make it more and more difficult for the women of D\u1ed7i Hamlet to come to their fields. Fetching firewood becomes more challenging because of sudden drainage from the hydropower plant. Sometimes heavy rains raise the water level, and they are stuck in the forest. Now as the mother of a four-year-old girl and the co-breadwinner of her little family, Thu has more to worry about. Every flood season gives her anxiety that her backyard garden by the river bank would collapse, taking with it her crop of cassava, or worse: the life of her family. During nights of great storms, Thu and her husband have to pack their things and run to their sister\u2019s house on the other side of the road for shelter, because their house has a leaky roof, and is very likely to be roofless from the wind.":"S\u1ef1 bi\u1ebfn chuy\u1ec3n b\u1ea5t ng\u1edd m\xe0 kh\xed h\u1eadu di\u1ec5n ra \u1edf Nam \u0110\xf4ng kh\xf4ng ch\u1ec9 \u0111\u1eb7t ra\n        nh\u1eefng th\xe1ch th\u1ee9c v\u1ec1 thu nh\u1eadp v\u1edbi Thu, m\xe0 h\u01a1n c\u1ea3 c\xf2n l\xe0 s\u1ef1 an to\xe0n c\u1ee7a\n        ng\u01b0\u1eddi d\xe2n trong th\xf4n. \u0110\u01b0\u1eddng tr\u01a1n tr\u01b0\u1ee3t, hay s\u1ea1t l\u1edf khi\u1ebfn nh\u1eefng ng\xe0y \u0111i\n        l\xe0m r\u1eaby v\u1edbi ch\u1ecb em \u1edf th\xf4n D\u1ed7i ng\xe0y c\xe0ng kh\xf3 kh\u0103n.

The increase in agricultural, forestry, fishery, and industrial production activities leads to the expansion of arable land.
