This boundary placed on age and ethnic groups\n          is both a strength and drawback of the project. On the one hand, this\n          common ground will create a framework for the story. At the age of\n          under 25, contributing to beterring the society seems too much to ask\n          of. As I\'ve just turned 25, I see myself in my character. At this age,\n          our connection with the past, present, or future can sometimes be\n          ambiguous. Besides, connections to our environment are impurified by\n          many layers of information, and so it is not so easy to see the\n          relationship between ourselves, nature, and our society. However, as I\n          decide on my group of characters, I am expecting to encounter their\n          unique, cultured reasoning in the way they react to their\n          surroundings. Each female character from my project comes from an\n          ethnical background, raised and nurtured by distinct culture, history,\n          and tradition.

Their development to be mothers from a young girl also alters their interaction with the world. I love observing them in shoots of life in their diversity. Looking for characters following certain criteria allows me to understand their context better, in intimate response with other women around them. While focusing on the characters, I too had a chance to get to know the life of many other women, beautiful and courageous, those who are in the same context and have the same, secret worries that can only be shared among women themselves. They support, love one another and raise one another up, so no one will be left behind in life adversities.

Climate change and gender inequality, put in larger contexts, could be both cause and effect to other problems.  During my journey of seeking and interacting with each character in their social circle, I\u2019ve encountered many patterns and questions those patterns neccesitate. Climate change has been pushing people to move, and immigration has unfortunately entailed trafficking of children and women, family abuse, changes in matriarchal families, and child exploitation.

These problems have been creating changes in family and social structure, creating disruptions in family and relatives relationships, not just in the present.

One of the two main breadwinners has to go to big cities to earn a living, because cultivating activities are not enough to support a living amid such a tight economic situation.

Therefore, besides words and images, I might have been a bit ambitious and saved every other small vibration to create a more vivid scene for the reader. During this journey, I realized in order for a work to be truly meaningful, I must make it "Live". The life of a work does not just stay at the outer appearance, in its images, videos, sounds, interviews, but it is alive so much as it creates a sincere vibe for the viewers, as well as inspires them to do something with it. For that, I am not going to limit "Who is she?" as my personal work, but I am offering it as communal, a work, a place where anyone can tell stories of women, education, and climate that they know . \u201cShe\u201d is no longer just stories I seek, but will also be the stories of so many courageous, beautiful, hard-working women out there.'}),(0,a.jsx)(i,{url:"/cheo/images/general/8.JPG",text:"Technically, this is also the journey where I see my own transformation within the process of experimentation.
