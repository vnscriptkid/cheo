There have been many difficulties and pains that Vietnamese people have experienced for the last decade.</p><p>For example, the Central floods have wreaked havoc on the lives of millions. Climate change&#x27;s effects, such as rising sea levels, saltwater intrusion, and prolonged droughts, have put millions of lives at risk in Vietnam&#x27;s Mekong Delta. However, many people have failed to recognize the importance of climate change in their lives, viewing it solely as a natural disaster. In many cases, there are only two in my country. More seriously, we must acknowledge that these challenges have threatened the Vietnamese people&#x27;s lives, particularly those of vulnerable and minority groups, and have drastically altered their lives in areas such as health, education, livestock, and so on.</p></div></div></main></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/about","query":{},"buildId":"FLJsRFRNJSFnbDK7yINZv","assetPrefix":"/cheo","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
