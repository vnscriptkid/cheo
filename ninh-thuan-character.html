The sound of thunder seemed closer by minutes. Rain drops started to mark their trails on the cement front yard. Quyen hurried to the back of her house, collecting the clothes she hung which were now exposed to the rain. Frequent afternoon rain has been a familiar sight during early April in Phuoc Binh, Ninh Thuan province where Quyen was born and raised.</p><p style="padding:0 300px">Years ago, when Ninh Thuan suffered a crisis of water shortage and drought, Quyen along with her family struggled with cultivation work, and so, better than ever, she treasured these early rains. Rains fertilize crops, refresh the air, and in such a place with stiflingly hot weather like Ninh Thuan, rains are the savior. With eagerness, Quyen waited for the beginning of the rainy season to start growing her crop after the scorching March. However, things have changed, and those downpouring, lingering rains are putting weight on her heart.</p><img width="100%" src="/cheo/images/ninh-thuan/final/05-min.jpg" alt="10"/><p style="padding:0 300px">Quyen’s hometown, Phuoc Binh, is a flat area with a national park whose vegetation is dense and diverse. This land has been welcoming and nourishing her family since the day they came to establish a new village decades ago. Fertile strips of land and cold, pleasing airflow are perfect for plants and trees to grow. Sources of fresh water flowing to the Cai River had never been exhausted. Rich land nurtured sweet pomelo orchards, fragrant coffee gardens, and green banana fields. But one cannot think of Phuoc Binh without its cashew farms. Cashew nuts brought the Raglai households their most stable income. During the pandemic, it was also the most reliable source, as the price of cashew nuts remained during and after it. However, cashew trees cannot stand steady rains. Rains make the cashew fruits lose their sweetness and even fall off the tree, and therefore declining yields. Instead of big sacks of cashew fruits, now Quyen could only collect 2 to 3 kilograms for the whole morning, which earns her family a humble day of food. For two years now, Phuoc Binh’s cashews that once lifted the Raglai out of poverty, have been mentioned with bitterness, “With all these rains… Phuoc Binh’s cashew crops are doomed to fail again!”</p><div style="display:flex"><img style="width:50%" src="images/ninh-thuan/final/04-min.jpg" alt="3.1"/><img style="width:50%" src="images/ninh-thuan/final/09-min.jpg" alt="3.2"/></div><p style="padding:0 300px">The word “again”, as much as it denotes the real repetition of the situation, connotes the people’s resignation of something out of their hand. After the 12th storm in 2020, the range of rainfall has been unpredictable. Rains are no longer a helper to crops and dry lands like they were to annual serious droughts in March, April, September, and October. Now, they are pouring as if Nature is taking all of her wraths out. Lasting heavy rains lead to floods. A large area from the south of Khanh Hoa to the north of Ninh Thuan, and to Phan Rang, is white with seething water foam, and in some places, the water is 2 to 4 meters deep. Besides flooding, whirlwinds are also a &quot;speciality&quot; often seen in Ninh Thuan in stormy seasons.</p><img width="100%" src="/cheo/images/ninh-thuan/final/01-min.jpg" alt="01"/><p style="padding:0 300px">The little house Quyen and her husband built after their marriage withstood the storms of 2020, but Quyen is doubtful it could stand the storms to come. The house she currently lives in with her mother is built on a loan, to fight the harsh weather on stormy days. Prolonged rains are not only a challenge to the daily life of the family, but they also make it common for farming households in the area to hopelessly wake up to their gardens messy with ruins of durian, pomelo, bananas, and cashew fruits.</p><div style="display:flex"><img style="width:50%" src="images/ninh-thuan/final/06-min.jpg" alt="3.1"/><img style="width:50%" src="images/ninh-thuan/final/07-min.jpg" alt="3.2"/></div><p style="padding:0 300px">It is difficult to encourage the Raglai to stay in the land that protected and loved them many years ago when things are no longer the same. We know that in any society changes are inevitable, but the layers and layers of problems piled up as transitions in climate, economic life, and family traditions interwoven, accelerate people seeking jobs away from home. On those trips to seek jobs, young women do not think about anything further than escaping the poverty besieging them, so that their small families can have a better life. Those rolling strips of arable land, the vast forests that once fed generations of their grandparents and parents, are now no longer sufficient to keep them whose eyes sparkle with sadness. For those who choose to work away for the first time, it is not easy for them to determine whether working in the factory or on the fields is easier. But at least, down to the plains where factories are tightly spaced, being paid with the starting salary, they could already earn an income 4 times as much as they do at home where they reply on some banana trees, humble crops of corn, cashew, pomelo orchards that easily affected by the erratic weather.</p><div><img style="width:100%;vertical-align:middle" src="/cheo/images/ninh-thuan/final/03-min.jpg" alt="03"/></div><p style="padding:0 300px">Many years ago, unable to resist the potential of earning more from big cities, Quyen packed up, and from Ninh Thuan she went to Nha Trang, a famous tourist coastal city 2-hour ride away from her house to work in a small local restaurant. With all her hard work from early morning until late at night, she earned only about 3 million VND which had to cover her rent and meals too. Very modestly as she lived, nothing much was left to send back to her parents. But at least, that&#x27;s how she, and other women her age, could earn a little more. After the Lunar New Year holiday of 2022, many of Quyen&#x27;s friends returned to the city for work. As for Quyen, when asked about this, she decisively shook her head: &quot;I love my children so much, I want to stay at home to take care of them. If we both go, the little poor ones would be so miserable.&quot;</p><img width="100%" src="/cheo/images/ninh-thuan/final/14-min.jpg" alt="01"/><p style="padding:0 300px">Seven in the morning, after feeding the children and sending them to her mother to look after them, Quyen starts her working day on her cultivation land by the mountain. Owning a lot of lands does not mean high income. It did, but that was the story of many years ago, when Quyen was just a 9th grader who spent her days off working on the farms to help her parents. In the memory of what seems like yesterday, she followed her parents and sisters to the farm on weekends. Wherever the land stretched, there stretched fruitful banana trees. There were plenty of them, from snow bananas, areca bananas (musa acuminata), and ducasse bananas. Moderate regular rainfall was an adequate supply for bananas to grow. The price of bananas was stable, which was the main source of income for her family, especially during Tet holidays. A fully grown banana tree does not just give fruit and leaves to sell, but other parts of it could be used in daily meals. Sadly, it is also in the same vivid memory that she sees the erratic storms, the most recent being storm No. 12 happened exactly 2 years ago which swept through her village, leaving behind it desolate, destroyed banana fields.</p><div style="display:flex"><img style="width:50%" src="images/ninh-thuan/final/13-min.jpg" alt="3.1"/><img style="width:50%" src="images/ninh-thuan/final/15-min.jpg" alt="3.2"/></div><p style="padding:0 300px">The traditional Raglai life is almost exclusively confined to the bur (neighborhood) or palei (village) in high, flat lands close to the water source. Each palei usually consists of dozens of households of one extended family. Upland agriculture is the dominant mode of production, with corn and rice as the main food sources. There are also other agricultural products such as cassava, potatoes, and fruits. Buffalo, cows, pigs, and chickens are widely raised but not on a large scale. Each family keeps a couple of cows for funeral ceremonies. The area in Ninh Thuan where the Raglai live has many rivers. It is those rivers and streams that provide water for domestic use and production irrigation. Besides, handicraft activities such as knitting, forging, pottery... rudimentary as they are, secure the people&#x27;s needs for daily life. Quyen&#x27;s grandparents and parents came here to set up a village, although they were poor, they were never hungry because they had the forests, the farms, the rivers, and the streams. Nights of hard work casting nets and mornings of picking vegetables in the forest can guarantee them meals for the week and enable them to bring up their children. But the changing socio-economic context poses new challenges, Quyen&#x27;s generation has more to worry about than just daily meals.</p><img width="100%" src="/cheo/images/ninh-thuan/final/17-min.jpg" alt="01"/><p style="padding:0 300px">The children grow, the prices increase, the pandemic ravages all, material and spiritual life experience transitions, .. these seemingly unrelated aspects are intertwined, creating systemic problems that affect the community as a whole. The majority of the Raglai people make a living on farming and animal husbandry. However, phenomena of climate extreme increasingly cause agricultural output to decline. With changes in livelihood, moving to another place to live and work is inevitably entailed. It is now hard to see young people on farms. Quyen&#x27;s husband and her best friend Nghiem had chosen to go to other provinces to either work in shrimp farms or go fishing in the open sea. The children, after school time, would be found attached to their grandparents who are no longer capable of backbreaking labor  and so leave the garden to their children to take care of. The migration for work of the majority of young and middle-aged people has caused many unpredictable consequences for the matriarchal family structure and traditional culture of the Raglai, one consequence being the lack of affection and education from parents in the children&#x27;s upbringing. Reciprocal poetic verses, epic songs of the mountains and forests are now set aside into a vague memory corner, giving way to arguments about who should work to raise children, who stay at home to take care of the farm. Quyen, no matter how pure and optimistic she is, cannot keep herself from these concerns.</p><div style="display:flex"><img style="width:50%" src="images/ninh-thuan/final/10-min.jpg" alt="3.1"/><img style="width:50%" src="images/ninh-thuan/final/12-min.jpg" alt="3.2"/></div><p style="padding:0 300px">Her life now is very different from what 15-year-old  Quyen would have imagined. Now, she is a mother of two little ones. She takes care of the children, of her own mother, and of everything in the family while her husband is away for work. The economic burden is heavier on her shoulders after the pandemic. She brought more than 20 kilograms of bananas down from the top of the mountain to sell them for no more than 40 thousand dongs each kilogram (about $1,7). The pomelos she took care of every day are forced to sell for only 10 thousand dongs (about $0,4). And, instead of tens of kilograms of cashews every day, now she could collect only 2 to 3 kilos. The weather changed remarkably compared to the days she followed her parents to the farms. It is much more real than what she learned about climate change, about hurricanes, droughts, floods, at school. Or maybe, it is more real to her because it directly affects her livelihood and her family.</p><p style="padding:0 300px">5:00 p.m on a Saturday, a 45-seat bus was parked in front of Quyen’s house. She quickly looked up to her front yard, where her close friend, Nghiem, was preparing to get on the bus. In just 12 hours, Nghiem would be in the city, where she wishes to find a job with a salary 5 to 6 times higher than what she and Quyen are earning here in Phuoc Binh, Ninh Thuan. It also means that it will be half a year ahead until they could meet again, and no more hanging out and pouring their heart out to each other every afternoon like before.
</p><img width="100%" src="/cheo/images/ninh-thuan/final/16-min.jpg" alt="01"/><p style="padding:0 300px">It is difficult for Quyen to say for sure whether it would eventually be her turn, when her two children grow a bit older, to get on the familiar bus which runs at 5 p.m every Saturday. Or would she still be able to hold on to the land where she was born and raised, with the erratic weather and the burden of making a living that pressures her shoulders? She can&#x27;t even be sure of next week, or of tomorrow, of how heavy the rain would pour, and how devastated her cashew farms would become.</p></div><video width="100%" class="videoTag" autoplay="" loop="" muted=""><source src="/cheo/videos/ninh-thuan/end.mp4" type="video/mp4"/></video></main></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/ninh-thuan-character","query":{},"buildId":"70dnfj-RlzaR52mjHvYv0","assetPrefix":"/cheo","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
